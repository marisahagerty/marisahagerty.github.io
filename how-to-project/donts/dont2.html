			<p> <h3>2. Plot vegeance. </h3> </p>
			<p>For the love of god, don't do anything rash.  Put your elaborate schemes of publicly humiliating or exposing your ex to rest.  Don't slash his tires or anything else that is damaging/illegal. Your heart may be broken but the law shouldn't be!
            <p>So unless you're Uma Thurman, I don't wanna hear that you've been on an epic revenge rampage. If you need to get your anger out, kick something or write your feelings in your journal.
