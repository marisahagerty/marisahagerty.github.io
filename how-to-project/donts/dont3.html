<h3>3. Contact your ex.</h3></p>

<p> You probably have a lot of unanswered questions, or there's things you didn't get to say in the heat of the moment.  Maybe they've already contacted you fresh after the breakup and you're restraining yourself from responding.

<p><b>Don't talk to them.</b>  At least, not for a while. What has been done is done. The wounds are still fresh, and even if you miss them, talking to them isn't going to help anything.  </p>
