                <h3>1. Play the blame game.</h3>
               	I'm sure you're kicking yourself over this, but don't. <b>It's <i>not</i> your fault.</b> 
                It's also <b>not their fault.</b> Except if they cheated on you, then yeah. That's totally their fault.  Screw them! </p>
                <p>
              	But, even more importantly, <b>it's no one else's fault!</b> Not your friends, their friends, their family, the other girl or guy they cheated on you with-- <b><i>no one!</i></b> They aren't the ones who made your ex do the things they did.  </p>
