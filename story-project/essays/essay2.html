<h3>Reminscence of a Rhinebeck Resident</h3>
	<p>My twin brother Matt invited our friends Thomas, Brian, Spencer, Justin, and another Thomas (whom we all referred to as “T-Netts,” which derives from his last name, Netter) over one Friday evening.  It was February, and the air was cold— not as cold as the weather usually is during this time, especially in the state of New York, but it was cold enough that I remember wearing a down coat and a scarf when I was outside.  I stood in the hallway as the six boys stood in a circle, talking loudly amongst themselves.  “It’s too early to go tubbing,” said Matt.  This was due to the fact that the guys liked to take a dip in our hot tub when it was dark out so they could see the multicolored lights seeping through the bubbling water and the array of glittering stars in the nighttime sky.  Somehow these things must have added to their relaxing hot tub experience, as well as their teenage-boy banter about “hot” girls from school, and Brian and Thomas’ sexual conquests with some of them.  </p>
    
	<p>“Well, what are we going to do then?” said Thomas.  As they struggled to come up with a decent plan that everyone agreed on,  I thought of the Village of Rhinebeck.  It was too late to peruse its various shops and restaurants; everything closes after five o’clock except for Village Pizza, which closes around ten.  They could have tried to see a movie at Lyceum Cinemas in Red Hook, but it was that time of year when there was nothing playing except low-budget comedies with under 50% approval ratings on Rotten Tomatoes.</p>  
    
	<p>Then, I thought of a better idea.  “Let’s go to Rhinecliff,” I announced, and all six of them turned their heads in my direction, unaware that I had been there for their whole conversation.  I had remembered the senior photo shoot that my mom’s photographer friend took of me and Matt near the Rhinecliff train station a few months prior, and figured that it would be an ideal spot to pass the time, and that the group of narcissistic young men that my brother and I hung out with would see it as an opportunity to take “artistic” photos of themselves in front of the gorgeous scenery.  I assumed correctly, because my brother then said to me, “That’s not a bad idea.  You can come with us, but only if you take epic photos of us.” </p>
    
	<p>I personally believe that Rhinecliff is the most picturesque part of Rhinebeck.  My parents used to take us out to dinner at the Rhineclif Hotel or drive us to the park near the train station so we could enjoy the beautiful river scenery and watch boats pass us by.  It is a place that always put me into a peaceful state of mind and usually inspires me to take photographs of the gorgeous scenery.</p>
	
    <p>After spending weeks at a time at my school in the middle of New York City’s concrete jungle, I tend to forget what foliage, mountains, and stars look like, so I like to return home for the weekend every once in a while.  After my two-hour train ride from New York Penn Station, I feel a sense of relief when I stumble onto the stone platform with my heavy duffle bag and look up to see the sky perfectly reflected onto the surface of the Hudson River, which is cradled between the green masses of land and purple mountains that make up the Hudson Valley.  It reminds me that although I am in love with my new urban lifestyle, no place is more of a “home” to me than the little town of Rhinebeck.</p>
      
	<p>Rhinebeck has a reputation for its history and culture.  It was founded by the Dutch during the 17th century.  We celebrate our heritage every December with our Sinterklaas Parade— an event which attracts people from all over the county for its culmination of art, music, and other Dutch Christmas traditions, as well as those of other cultures.   Rhinebeck is home to The Beekman Arms, which advertises itself as “the oldest inn in America” (although no Rhinebecker is totally sure if this is a fact or not).  Apparently, George Washington stayed at the inn briefly before the American Revolution took place.  Chelsea Clinton, daughter of another former U.S. President, got married in Rhinebeck in 2010, which gave our town more publicity than it has ever had.  It was summer, and I had just graduated eighth grade.  I remember logging onto Facebook and seeing my newsfeed filled with photos of Bill Clinton smiling and waving to a crowd of townspeople outside the restaurant Gigi’s and being upset that I had missed it. </p>
     
	<p> People from all over the state of New York, particularly Manhattanites, are drawn to Rhinebeck because of these aspects, as well the fact that we host the famous Dutchess County Fair every August.  Every weekend, particularly over the summer due to the opening of the fairgrounds, I have a difficult time finding a place to park in the Village due to the swarms of out-of-towners.  In spite of this, young Rhinebeckers like myself find themselves to be extremely bored during every other time of the year.   Rhinebeck has no malls, fast food, movie theaters, or any of the creature comforts and sources of entertainment that every town is supposed to have.  My brothers and I have to travel to nearby towns and cities to find what we want— usually to Red Hook, which is ten minutes away, or Kingston, which is twenty minutes away, in a different county, and requires a commute over the Kingston-Rhinecliff bridge.  This only became a noteworthy issue for me in high school.  I attended a catholic school in Kingston, where I was constantly surrounded by the fun activities of that city and grew increasingly tired of living in my seemingly dull hometown.  </p>
    
	<p> After living in Rhinebeck for eighteen years, I was certain that I wanted to go to college in an urban setting.  “I would not be able to stand living in the middle of nowhere for four years,” I told my mom after my family visited Cornell University— the epitome of the style of living that I wanted to avoid.  “I want to be able to go to Panera or something if I want to, and go where there’s a lot going on.”  My mom apparently only paid attention to the part about Panera because ever since that day, she would tell my friends’ parents that I would only go to a college that was near to one.  The only reason that I used it as my example was because having spent a lot of time with my friends in Kingston, where Paneras and many other corporate stores and restaurant chains were easy to access, I now resented where I lived.   </p>
    
	<p> In Rhinebeck, I also felt a sense of isolation.  After spending four years in the public school system, witnessing the things that have happened to my brothers who went to school in Rhinebeck even longer than I did, and growing up with locals who attended the same Church as me, I can attest to the fact that Rhinebeckers commonly are stuck-up and have bad attitudes.   Every time I see one of my friends from Church or my days in Chancellor Livingston Elementary School, they hardly muster a “hello” to me, or completely ignore me, even though they recognize me.  I was ostracized as soon as I left the school district to go to a Catholic middle school in Hyde Park, as if people were offended that I rejected Rhinebeck.  Matt eventually left also because he found the student population to be unwelcoming and snobbish.  If you aren’t attending a college with an acceptance rate under 10%, they don’t care about what you have to say.   The student body was a giant clique that you could only fully be a part of if you have gone to school with them long enough, so my brother and I were automatically outsiders.  The reputation that Rhinebeck School District’s education and college placement has was not enough; we wanted no part in the vicious culture of their youth.  </p>
    
	<p> All of our close friends live either in Kingston or in the proximity of our high school, so in Rhinebeck, I feel even more bored due to having no one local to hang out with.  I am always more than eager to drive twenty or more minutes across the Rhinecliff Bridge just to see my friends and have something interesting to do.   Ironically, they always want spend time with my brother and I in Rhinebeck.  Ever since junior year of high school, they would come over nearly every Friday night to hang out, play video games, and swim in our pool and hot tub.  I used to think they were using me and my brother for our hot tub because it was hard to believe that anyone would genuinely want to come to Rhinebeck to hang out.  </p>
    
	<p> My anti-Rhinebeck attitude finally changed when we took our friends to Rhinecliff for the first time last February.  They all agreed to go, since few things were more important to my brother and his friends than an opportunity to post glamorous photos of themselves onto social media.   I decided to ride with Spencer in his black pickup truck while the rest of the boys piled into Justin’s red jeep.  When we got to the river, the sky had turned dark blue with bright pink and orange clouds striated across it.  The river, covered in fragmented sheets of ice, perfectly reflected the sky, and the mountains and terrain across the river were silhouetted in black.  My brother and I smiled with pride as the non-Rhinebeckers stared in awe.  Our proximity to the Hudson River was something we took pride in, as our Kingston friends did not experience it.  </p>
    
	<p> My brother forced me to take pictures the silhouettes of the six boys in front of the sunset with my iPhone camera before it became too dark to take a potential Facebook cover photo.  Afterwards, Spencer and Brian sat on a bench and discussed their exploits with women, Justin, Matt, and Thomas took turns tossing stones across the water ripples, and T-Netts and I sat on the edge of the dock, silently enjoying the beauty of the Hudson Valley, even in the darkness. </p>
    
	<p>“Look over there,” said T-Netts, pointing to a bright green light at the edge of a dock on the opposite side of the river.  I laughed as he reached his hand out to it in reference to The Great Gatsby.  In that moment, I noticed the lights of buildings on the other side of the river scattered across the black strip of land.  “There’s Kingston,” said Brian, joining the group at the edge of the dock.  </p>
    
	<p> “Oh yeah,” I responded, still looking out into the distance.  Like how Jay Gatsby looked longingly at the green light on Daisy Buchanan’s dock, I was looking out at the lights of a city that I wished I lived in— a city with Panera, countless sources of entertainment, and my closest friends.  </p>
    
	<p> “I wish Kingston was as pretty as this,” Brian sighed.  “I love coming here.  Kingston is so gross and gray.  When I’m here, I appreciate the beauty and nature, and feel more at peace with my thoughts.”  He looked at all of us and smiled, his green eyes shimmering with emotion.  “I’m so glad I met you, Matt and Marisa.  I have so much fun when I come over.”  </p>
    
	<p> I felt much happier after hearing these words, not only due to their kindness, but also the fact that I suddenly felt less animosity towards Rhinebeck.  It occurred to me that if my friends were near the Hudson River on their side, they probably would look across at Rhinebeck in the same way I looked at Kingston: envious of a lifestyle that they did not have.  Months later, when I moved to New York for college, I finally fully understood how Brian and my other friends must have felt.  Though I am constantly entertained by what the city has to offer and would never trade the convenience of living in Manhattan for anything in the world, I always find myself longing to return to the simplicity and natural beauty of a home that I had taken for granted. </p>
