<h3>There's Something About Steampower</h3>
<p>
My inner geek came out in after years of being dormant in October, when I attended this year’s New York Comic Con with a few of my guy friends for three days.  The time I spent as an internet junkie in my lonely middle school years apparently paid off, as I was able to identify many of the references and nerdy subcultures within the swarms of cosplayers.  My favorite one was a man shouting “Not the bees!” and wearing a basket of fake, swarming bees on his head to represent Nicholas Cage in The Wicker Man.  I raised my eyebrow at a cluster of twenty or more Deadpools meandering through the dense crowds, and shuddered at the various bronies that invaded the Javits Center.  </p>

	<p>A recent poll by clinical psychologists showed that on average, 23% of males and 50% of females attend conventions to cosplay.  I was part of the other half of the female population that does not partake in such activity.  Through Facebook, I saw that one of my good friends, Duane, attended the one day of the convention that I didn’t attend as a part of the small percentage of his gender that does cosplay.  He wore the black suit, tie, and top hat and highly detailed, shiny robot makeup that constitutes his steampunk persona, Razor Blade— an automaton that is member of a band of similar robots, The Musical Mechanical Men, formed by Duane and his friends over a year ago.  I was not surprised when I discovered this; as a professional makeup artist and hardcore steampunk fan, it was only expected that if he was going to cosplay at Comic Con, it was going to be as an automaton of some sort.  Also, the convention was filled with other cosplayers in the steampunk community, whether as their original characters (or “OC’s), or as  steampunked versions of famous characters in pop culture (for example, one attendee went as “Steampunk Pikachu”). </p>
    
	<p>There is no single definition of steampunk; it is easily one of the broadest subcultures within the internet and nerd-convention community.  Duane described it as “a culture based on a time period when the industrial revolution started” in terms of fashion and values, and a world in which “everything is powered by steam and gears.”  The Merriam-Webster dictionary has a similar definition: “Science fiction dealing with 19th-century societies dominated by historical or imagined steam-powered technology.”  Some expressions of steampunk, however, involve even early 20th-century societies.  Alexis, a fashion design major who lives on my floor in FIT’s Coed Hall, told me that she prefers to combine steampunk elements with the age of swing dancing, as well as the 1920’s occasionally.  “You’ll talk to everybody who does steampunk and they’re going to have a different description because it means something different to them,” she said.   So, there is no single way to define steampunk; there are only the common elements of historical time periods, steam power, and fantasy.   </p>
    
	<p>Since most aspects of steampunk appear to deal with time periods in which women had few rights, I was curious as to how that affected female members of the steampunk community.  Conventions such as New York Comic Con have recently been avidly trying to prevent sexual harassment, which has become a huge problem at conventions across the country.  Overall, there is not an identifiable problem with sexism in steampunk, since a majority of cosplayers are women and because men and women do so many things that blur gender roles within aspects of steampunk.  However, even though groups such as steampunk have such strong foundations of acceptance and free expression, regardless of race, sex, or orientation, there are always people within the communities that show prejudice and create problems.  For these reasons, it seemed appropriate to ask Alexis what her opinion was.  “I’m not really sure,” she replied.  “All I know is when I do outfits that are very Victorian, I am showing a lot more skin than women would ever show off.”  After looking up various female steampunk cosplays in my quest for knowledge, I learned that a lot of girls tend to defy the confines of old style fashion as well as gender roles.  Instead of wearing skirts, many women wear pants, or carry industrial-styled weapons (such as handguns) to create the appearance of strong, heroine-like characters.  Since a majority of cosplayers are women and because men and women do so many things that blur gender roles within the subculture, many women find that the steampunk community</p>
    
<p>	It is easy to determine if a cosplay falls into the steampunk category because there are a few common elements that many costumes share: leather, straps, buckles, lace, feathers, and sometimes aspects of the steam powered, mechanical technology used during that age.  Men wear 19th-century style dress shirts, vests, jackets, pants, and shoes, often accompanied by a bowler or top hat.  Women most commonly wear corsets, but have been known to incorporate men’s fashion into their cosplays as well.  Last weekend, I visited a costume shop near Union Square on Fourth Avenue called “Gothic Renaissance,” which was known for selling steampunk attire in addition to other old-style costume pieces, and its walls were completely covered hundreds of different styles of corsets, varying in color, bust size, and material.  Near the store’s entrance, there is a section with very small accessories in which I found a monocle, a key, and a “bag of gears”— all of which are specifically, physically labelled under “steampunk.”   </p>

	<p>In the next room, there is an entire rack of goggles, which are a very commonly used steampunk accessory.  These goggles are often bulky with metallic or leather textures,  held together by leather straps, and contain gears or some other decoration that is reminiscent of mechanical technology.  I have seen so many cosplayers wearing these goggles, and I never understood why (and apparently, neither does the steampunk community, but a lot of them believe that it has something to do with the appeal of inventors of old fashioned, steam-powered technology, as seen in movies such as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang).  Alexis made her own pair of goggles, which is copper-textured with a leather strap and studs on their rims.  I found another pair of goggles with the same studs in Gothic Renaissance, as well as pairs with wings, bolts, or no adornments at all.  I tried on three different pairs— all of which could hardly fit over my big head— and was not able to actually see with them.  I then remembered that people I’ve seen wearing steampunk goggles don’t actually wear them over their eyes; they just sit on their forehead or hat as a functionless accessory.  </p>
    
	<p> When I went to Comic Con, I was not as adept at identifying members of the steampunk community as I am now; my only familiarity with the subculture was the steam-powered robots that Duane liked to create.  My official introduction to steampunk occurred when I met Duane last spring, toward the end of my senior year at John A. Coleman High School.  He was given the task of creating and applying the makeup that was being used in our spring musical, Shrek the Musical, and, since I was also a part of the production and we both lived about the same distance from Coleman, I was given the task of driving him there for tech week and the performances.  In those two weeks of carpooling, we became close, and I learned a lot about his variety of interests: makeup, ventriloquism, acting, singing, writing, and probably many others that I don’t know about.</p>
    
	<p> During one of our last drives together, I asked him what kind of music he liked, and offered my car’s auxiliary cord for his usage.  He plugged in his phone and we listened to the song “Honeybee” by the steampunk music group Steam Powered Giraffe.  The song is slow-paced and features a blend of three-part vocal harmony and an acoustic guitar.   Since my taste in music usually falls within the confines of the pop and rock genres, this was an entirely new and strange sound to me.  </p>
    
	<p>Created by twins David Michael Bennett and Isabella “Bunny” Bennett in 2008 in San Diego, California, Steam Powered Giraffe is a “musical pantomime troupe” featuring the automaton personas of the band’s founders and performer Samuel Luke along with a cast of other characters.  Their vocals are performed by the three main members under the guise of their automaton characters— Rabbit, The Spine, and Hatchworth— with their own unique costumes and robot makeup.  Duane describes their music as “vaudeville-style,” which fits with the band’s steampunk theme, and having listened to some their songs during an entire half-hour car ride, I can agree with that description.  They have released several albums and perform at venues and conventions all over the country.  Though the band is relatively new, they have acquired a large following in the steampunk community.  Some of these fans are very protective of the band and, like all internet fans of creative groups, get very upset at the prospect of people ripping them off.  “At the slightest hint of danger, they will be like Mama Grizzly Bear,” said Duane, whose cover band got attacked by members of the Steam Powered Giraffe fan community for that very reason.</p>
    
	<p> Duane, along with his friends Charlie and Doug, formed The Musical Mechanical Men as a cover band of Steam Powered Giraffe about two years ago.  The boys, accompanied by human musicians, perform music and entertain audiences with their own robot personas— Razor Blade, The Split, and Tinsworth—  each with their own makeup designs and costumes, much like the band they parody.  It was first established when a woman who runs a talent show in the town of Red Hook, NY overheard the boys leisurely playing piano and singing to “Honeybee” in the basement of the Rhinebeck Performing Arts Center.  She asked them to perform at the show, and they agreed.  Their debut was a success; afterwards, many audience members that were intrigued by the “quaint little group of three guys with shiny faces with little mechanical movements” asked Duane if the band had a website that they could follow.  He made up a Tumblr URL for their band on the spot, which would eventually accumulate over one hundred followers (which, according to Duane, is good for a band on Tumblr). </p> 
    
<p>	During the next year, The Musical Mechanical Men would make several appearances at other functions throughout the Hudson Valley after their Red Hook debut, including the Dutchess County Fair and most recently Franklin D. Roosevelt High School’s pep rally.  Their Tumblr page proudly displays their photoshoots, fan art, videos, and blog posts about what the band members are currently up to.  When their band first flew off the ground, however, they got themselves into a little bit of trouble.  The Musical Mechanical Men did not specify that they were a cover band of Steam Powered Giraffe because they thought it was obvious that they were “fanbots.”  However, seven months after the band was formed, the steampunk community and Steam Powered Giraffe fandom came across their Tumblr, which had posted a recent photoshoot of the band, and mistook their parody band for an SPG ripoff.  Their Tumblr posts and Youtube videos were filled with hateful comments and threats.  The Musical Mechanical Men were shocked and overwhelmed by the outbursts.  Duane told me that they would receive twenty hate messages “every hour” on his Tumblr.  </p>

	<p> “The steampunk community is vicious.” he said.  Although this incident was resolved by a simple explanatory post on Duane’s Tumblr page, and the steampunk Tumblr community now loves their band, he still used the same adjective to describe them a few weeks ago.  “They are very loving and very accepting but at the same time… they are vicious and they are ruthless.”  I could not accept the thought of such a large group of people being labelled as “vicious,” so I asked Alexis what she thought of the steampunk community.  “I say it depends on who you talk to, but it’s the same with every fandom,” she said.  “You always get those people who are very vicious about what they do and believe that you can’t have any fun with it, like it’s all a job.  I tend to avoid those people because I do things just for fun.” </p>
    
	<p>It’s also understandable to be bitter and defensive when most of the outside world laughs at something that you take so seriously.  “I think they think we’re crazy,” Alexis said to me.  “When I talk about myself, I don’t really bring up the fact that I do steampunk, the fact that I’m a cosplayer, or the fact that I LARP, especially.  People think that all the crazy people are what always happens, and you don’t wanna be associated with them.” </p>
    
	<p> When she said this, I thought back to Comic Con.  I kept all of my own geeky interests a secret for so many years until I went there, yet I was silently making fun of so many different groups of “crazy” cosplayers and fans.  It then occurred to me that even these groups are judgmental of one another.  I thought of something Duane had said, regarding how other convention groups view steampunk: “It’s almost like the default community when you have no other community.”  Almost every nerd subculture I can think of is full of people who long for a sense of community, yet ironically, they are very exclusive of one another.  Whether outside or inside their communities, there is no escape from judgement; it perplexes me to no extent.  With that being said, I can’t help but wonder which category of “vicious” I would fall under.  </p>
