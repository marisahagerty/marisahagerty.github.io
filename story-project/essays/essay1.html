<h3>Gullible with a "Z"</h4>
“Isabelle, you are the most gullible person I know.”  Jimmy snickered from his seat diagonal from her.  My eyes diverted to where Isabelle was sitting in the row in front of me, expecting to see her get flustered and make her usual defensive comments, but she sat quietly in her seat, her face flushed.    As her best friend, I normally would have defended her, but instead I silently agreed with Jimmy.  I knew her well enough to acknowledge her ditzy tendencies.  Besides, I had been zoned out until this point in the conversation, so my input would have been unwarranted.  <p>
	“That reminds me,” said Charlie, “I have a really good Isabelle story.”  It was our last day of classes, so Mr. Goho had asked our AP Government class to share our favorite memories from our four years at Coleman High School.  I smirked, knowing exactly which story Charlie was about to tell because I had heard it numerous times before, and it was still just as funny as the first time he told it to me.  
<p>
	Charlie was about halfway back to Kingston during a bus ride from New York City.  His entire day was spent exploring the city and seeing a matinee of Evita on Broadway with a small group that consisted of members of Coleman’s French and Spanish clubs.  The time had passed through the assistance of the many people that texted him throughout the trip.  
	While in the midst of one of his virtual conversations, he received a text from Isabelle: “Hey! What did I miss in English?”  
	He stared at the text message, contemplating his response.  Did she really not know that he was absent from school?  He had told her about this field trip numerous times all week.  “We changed our book again.” He replied, jokingly.  A week ago, their sophomore English class started to read and discuss The Secret Life of Bees, but the unit was cancelled and the books were collected abruptly after the death of a classmate’s mother, who was in no emotional state to read about a character who also had a deceased mother.  They then began to read Ethan Frome as its permanent replacement— a book which lacked both a dead mother and the interest of the entire class.   <p>
	Within minutes, Charlie received another text from Isabelle.  “Oh, good!  I hated that book.  What are we reading now?”  He was at a loss of words, unable to understand how she took what was clearly a joke so literally.  Hoping she would catch on, he spent the next few minutes brainstorming fake book titles.  When he settled on the most ridiculous one, he sent it to her.  “Erotic New York by Judy Blume.”<p>
	Her response baffled him.  “Oh, okay!  What’s it about?”  Several questions flooded his mind: “Why would she actually believe that they would read a book called Erotic New York at a Catholic school?”,  “Why would she think that Judy Blume, a children’s author, would write such a book?”, and, “Why does she believe me?”   Soon, everyone on the bus heard the Erotic New York story and shared his amusement.  <p>
	He was about to come clean about his lies when he received a follow-up message from her: “I’m at Barnes and Noble, and they said that they don’t have that book.  Are you lying to me?”  Charlie began to laugh so hard that it left his sides sore and his eyes filled with tears.  <p>

	The entire room burst into a similar fit of laughter after Charlie completed his tale.  Even Isabelle laughed a little.  “No,” she said, “I knew you were kidding!  I mean, I didn’t when you said we changed the book, but I was playing along with it after that!”  
    <p>
	I knew Isabelle well enough to acknowledge that this was probably not true.  At the beginning of junior year, she briefly dated a new student in our class named Casey.  Everyone in our grade knew that they were together, but after Isabelle broke up with him, she would deny that they ever had a relationship or that she ever harbored any feelings toward him.  She only admitted the truth to me and our friend Justin once, but would continue to lie about it to everyone else.  The most likely reason for this was that many people in our high school class shared a mutual dislike for Casey. 
    <p>
	“You definitely believed it.” Charlie scoffed.  “Don’t lie!”
    <p>
	“This is just like the time you said that you didn’t date Casey, but you obviously did!”  Justin said from his seat next to Isabelle.  I smiled, because it was like he read my mind.  He and I always would poke fun at her for many of the stupid things she has done, but particularly her weird denial of dating Casey.  We were two of her closest friends at the time, so I never considered it to be mean because she knew we were being facetious.  
    <p>
	“We didn’t really date, though!” Isabelle protested.  “It wasn’t even official.  We were just friends!”  At this point, I noticed Isabelle began to appear visibly upset.  The rest of the room was too caught up in laugher to notice that her face was even redder than before and that her eyes appeared glossy from tears she was trying to hold back. 
    <p> 
	“One time, I convinced Isabelle that the word ‘gullible’ had a ‘Z’ in it.” Zoe, who sat at the opposite end of the room, joined the conversation.  No one reacted, partially because people did not like Zoe, and partially because her statement was not nearly as funny as Charlie’s Erotic New York story.  Isabelle was silent at first, and then replied calmly, “I don’t remember that…”<br>
	“You totally did!”  Zoe argued, “It was in eighth grade. I told you the word ‘gullible’ had a ‘Z’ in it, and you believed me!”
    <p>
      Isabelle continued to deny having any memory of this, maintaining a cool composure compared to how flustered she was when we discussed Erotic New York and Casey.  I could tell from the expressions of people around her that they believed Zoe, because I knew that not a single person in the room thought that Isabelle had any common sense due to these stories being told.  At this point, it didn’t matter that she had brought them candy on Halloween, that she had bought each and every one of them a small gift for the class’ Christmas party, or that she volunteered more time than any of them to raise money for the senior class that she loved so much.  Her one flaw made her nothing but a joke that everyone wanted to have a part in, and no one respected her.  
      <p>
	My anger started to build up.  There was no was Zoe’s story was true, and I knew full well that she had no problem with lying about another person just to look cool and be a part of the conversation.  Due to a combination of my loathing for her and sympathy for Isabelle, I blurted out, “That just doesn’t even sound real.  Isabelle isn’t that stupid.”  After a moment, I added, “No one is that stupid.”  I felt Zoe’s contemptuous stare like a knife for making her look bad, but I paid no heed to it.  
    <p>
	After that, Mr. Goho acknowledged that the bell was about to ring, and gave us his final words.  I was too occupied with my thoughts at that moment to listen to anything he said to us.  As soon as the bell rang, we hastily made our way out of the class room, and the group of students that made up my study hall the following period took their usual seats at the table in the library with a giant puzzle on it.  
    <p>
	From the corner of my eye, I saw Isabelle taking a seat on the couch next to our table.  “I can’t stand Zoe.”  I said, not giving her eye contact.  She took a moment to finish checking her phone, and then replied, “Yeah, thanks for defending me.  You’re a good friend.”  I smiled, but on the inside, a feeling of guilt was triggered by what she said.  A good friend wouldn’t have laughed at the expense of another friend. A better friend would have spoken up earlier and prevented the entire conversation.  A best friend, like I was supposed to be, wouldn’t have made fun of her at all.
