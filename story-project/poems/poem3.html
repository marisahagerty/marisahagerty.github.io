<h3>Aquatic Sonnet</h3>
Water has always fascinated me.<br>
I feel most content when I’m by the sea,<br>
Or when sunsets color the river stream.<br>
On many occasions in my dreams,<br>
A flood has taken over my dream-world.<br>
No matter what kind of plot has unfurled,<br>
People swim instead of walking to locations,<br>
Stairways are waterfalls and chairs are flotations,<br>
And for whatever reason, I don’t care.<br>
I’d move to somewhere coastal if I dared<br>
To leave New York, but I’m fine with staying.<br>
Though the Hudson River keeps on decaying,<br>
I still think it’s lovely with city light<br>
Colors painted on the ripples at night.
