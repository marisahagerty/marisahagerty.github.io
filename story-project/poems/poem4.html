<h3>One "S"</h3>
I would not be Marisa if my brother wasn’t Matt.<br>
My mom thought it would be cute to have “M&M” twins.<br>
She also made the bold decision to spell my name<br>
With one “S.”<p>

Apparently my name is supposed to be spelled with two,<br>
Because not a single teacher, friend, or acquaintance <br>
Got the memo that I spell my name<br>
With one “S.”<p>

I’ve been called Marissa, Marrissa, Merissa,<br>
Even Mariska (Hargitay) or Maritza (by a barista).<br>
Anything but Marisa<br>
With one “S.”<p>

It’s even been pronounced incorrectly;<br>
It’s muh-RISS-uh, not mah-REES-uh.<br>
Why is it so hard? Everyone knows a Marisa<br>
With one “S.”<p>

Ironically, the name Marisa has left the vocabulary<br>
Of everyone closest to me.  To my family and friends,<br>
I’m Ris or Mar; there’s no need to remember to spell Marisa<br>
With one “S.”
