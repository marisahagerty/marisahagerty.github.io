<h3>A Sonnet You'll Never Read</h3>
Our love was brief but intensifying, <br>
Like the latest trend, or a shooting star.<br>
We weren’t perfect, but I have yet to find<br>
something as satisfying as what we had.<p>

I can’t take back what I said, or forget your harsh words.<br>
You were right, and I was too,<br>
yet we were both horribly wrong, all at once.<p>

I want to erase you, but I can’t lose<br>
the times your hand warmed mine on winter nights,<br>
art galleries, half-watched movies, and that<br>
time you tried teaching me to ballroom dance, <br>
or when you told me that my blue eyes glow.<p>

It doesn’t hurt anymore, but I still feel that void that you left.<br>
Even though half a year has passed and you’ve moved on.
