<h3>A Player's Warning</h3>
Since you seem like you’re nice and everything,<br>
I’m obligated to warn you that<br>
Even though I’m following you like a puppy now,<br>
I move around like an alley cat. <p>

Don't let me persuade you to stay the night. <br>
Even if you've had too much to drink,<br>
Get out of there fast, quick, before <br>
I trap you, and you overthink.<p>

Don't listen to what I tell you about me, or even about you.<br>
You might think you've been let in<br>
Because I fool you into thinking<br>
You've cut deep through my tough skin.<p>

Don't get too used to being in my arms,<br>
My birthmark, or making me smile,<br>
Because this little affair I refuse to define <br>
Isn’t special, and will hardly last a while. <p>

Don't let me kiss you or bite your lip<br>
Because my venom will seep in,<br>
And once it’s spread through your body and mind,<br>
That's when the negligence will begin.<p>

Don’t tell your friends that I'm your boy<br>
Because in public, I’ll treat you otherwise.<br>
Even though my neck is covered with proof of you,<br>
When people ask, I’ll always lie.<p>

Don’t be surprised when our conversations stop,<br>
And your messages are read but ignored.<br>
You should have thought twice when I told you<br>
That everything eventually leaves me bored.<p>

Don’t confront me about why I never ask you out anymore.<br>
Don’t cry about me to my friends.<br>
And before I have the chance to break you,<br>
Put this bullshit to an end.<p>

Don’t give me any more chances;  Move on while you can.<br>
Don’t try to understand me or my world,<br>
Because none of your overthinking will be worth it<br>
When you catch me kissing another girl.
<p>
