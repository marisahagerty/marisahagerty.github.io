<h3>[Untitled]</h3>
When I first met him, I was perplexed<br>
Because behind his crooked, wired specs<br>
Is a brilliant mind with an impeccable vision.<br>
His creations for class impressed me every week.<br>
His perspective of people and things<br>
Is so rare and unique,<br>
And I aspired to be like him.<br>
In a world full of mediocrity,<br>
He is the brightest light that I’ve seen in this city.<p>

As time passed, his creativity faded.<br>
The oppressiveness of institution<br>
Left him understandably jaded.<br>
Education systems break people like him<br>
To keep them from soaring too high<br>
Over their peers of flightless birds.<br>
I tried to keep him above the ground,<br>
Save him from circling around the drain.<br>
I lost sleep worrying over his future,<br>
While he found sleep because he gave up on it.<p>

Now the teacher has fallen behind the pupil,<br>
And watching it go down just brings me pain.<br>
His eyes, once gleaming with aspirations <br>
Are now sad and branded by red veins,<br>
Because the joy he once had from creating<br>
Has been replaced by artificial elations.<br>
His brain, once beaming with ideas,<br>
Is constantly dulled by substance after substance.<br>
Week after week, his effort deteriorates, <br>
And his critiques and praise become meaningless.<p>

My hero is his own kryptonite,<br>
And I’ve finally realized now<br>
That there’s nothing I can do to save him.<br>
It truly puzzles me, how<br>
Some gifted humans succeed and grow,<br>
Have their names in headlines and shows,<br>
While others let their talent go stale,<br>
Throw away their dreams, morals, and health,<br>
Allow their life to unravel apart,<br>
And break the people they’ve inspired’s hearts.
